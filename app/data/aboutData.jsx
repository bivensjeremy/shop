For those who have viewed by portfolio and GitHub, you will notice I initially created this same shop using vanilla React. Since then, I have learned a lot more and wanted to update the site with a more modern feel and added functionality. It is built using Next JS, Next UI, Commerce JS and Stripe along with a host of dependencies.'

As such, I had access to all the latest fashion at a discount. As you may remember, the 2000s was a crazy time for urban wear.  We liked our clothes with extra breathing room! Most of these items are extremely lightly worn. Because they have always been in such good condition, I have been reluctant to throw them away.  I have always intended to sell them at the flea market, but I have no desire to wheel & deal, haggle and negotiate.'
